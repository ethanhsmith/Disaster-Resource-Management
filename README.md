# A Resource Management App for Disaster Centers

This is an app to manage essential resources such as food, water, shelter in different disaster centers. A team leader at a location can immediately see the current stock of essential resources and request for more supplies from other locations. 

We want to use progressive web app because we want to be able to see stock items in low connectivity situations. 

Stretch goal: it would be great to apply this app to volunteer human resources too (e.g. dispatching medically trained staff to a disaster center).
